||      ||  ||  ||  ||  ||    EDIT FOR EJPHUD ft. Hephaestus
Version 0.8.5

==================================================================================================================
||														||
||What you must do to set the apropriate measures is:								||
||1. POOTIS master folder into Teamfortress2 => TF => Custom							||
||														||
||2. Go to library -> left click on TF2 -> properties -> set launch options (on bottom left)			||
||	Here you paste => "sv_unlockedchapters 1" <= with the quotes						||
||														||
||3. Calibrate the Background by pressing the KBATH Button once and restarting your game			||
||				Press again and restart to change background					||
||														||
||If you want to enable KAWAIIBATH mode manually, Go to cfg->autoexec.cfg					||
||				and paste	"sv_unlockedchapters 4"						||
||														||
||														||
||Tip = To destroy all risk of KawaiiBath mode being turned on at a bad time, refer to instructions in:		||
||							Scripts->KawaiiBathOverride.txt				||
||Tip = Be sure to change your crosshair, default might not look good with the wings				||
||														||
==================================================================================================================
||To Do:				||
||Tweak colors actually see the welcome	||
||	and selected buttons		||
||					||
==========================================
